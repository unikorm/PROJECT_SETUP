# PROJECT_SETUP
setup files and stuff to start quickly new project, it will be more enhance by time and my experiences...

this is like it works:
adamaanna@MacBook-Air-uzivatela-Adam project_Setup % python3 projectSetUp.py
Enter the project directory: /Users/adamaanna/documents/www
Enter the project name: hahaha

I execute following commands to create this folder, first i write "python3 projectSetUo.py" command, that call my Python file where is function to create this magic. Then terminal ask me to specific folder to save and then name of creating folder, and that it for now
